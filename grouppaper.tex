\textbf{Abstract}

\begin{abstract}
Our paper is \textit{Time-Work Tradeoffs for Parallel Algorithms}, \textit{Spencer\cite{S97}}. In this paper, Spencer focuses on several open parallel problems that are affected by the transitive closure bottleneck. For each of the below problems, Spencer describes an algorithm that comes closer to work efficiency than existing approaches that utilize transitive closure. However, this increased work efficiency comes at the cost of an asymptotic increase in the span of each algorithm relative to the time optimal solution. Spencer's motivation for prioritizing work efficiency over time efficiency stems from the fact that existing transitive closure solutions to these problems perform significantly worse than their sequential counterparts when run on only a single processor.

\underline{Problems}
\begin{itemize}
\item Solving Triangular Systems of Linear Equations
\item Topological Sort
\item Breadth-First Search in Directed Graphs
\item Strongly Connected Components
\item Single Source Shortest Path
\end{itemize}

Rather than using a matrix based approach, Spencer utilizes a few new data structures called \textit{nearby lists}, \textit{frontier lists}, \textit{inverse nearby lists}, and \textit{inverse frontier lists} that provide the necessary bookkeeping for the subsequent algorithms. \\

%	INTRODUCTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Introduction}

\textit{Spencer\cite{S97}} focuses on the problems for which there is no known efficient parallel algorithm that solves them. That is, there is no known parallel algorithm that is able to solve them in work that is within a logarithmic factor of the fastest sequential algorithm, where work is the product of the running time and the processor count. \textit{Spencer\cite{S97}} develops parallel algorithms that solves the following problems presented in Karp-Ramachandran\cite{KR90}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Directed Spanning Tree
\item Breadth-First Search
\item Topological Sort
\item Cycle Detection for Directed Graphs
\item Strong Connected Components
\item Single Source Shortest Paths with Non-Negative Edges
\end{itemize}

His algorithms exhibit a time-work trade-off, that is, the longer they run, the less work they perform. This phenomenon exists due of the fact that certain speculative computations can be eliminated as time progresses, thus reducing work. One algorithm solves topological sort and the other algorithm solves breadth first search. It was mentioned in passing that the breadth first search algorithm can solve directed spanning trees and the topological sort algorithm can solve cycle detection for directed graphs. Furthermore, the breadth first search algorithm can be applied to strongly connected components and extended to single source shortest paths with non-negative edges.\\

\textbf{\textit{/* Note: We may or may not need these definitions here. */}}\\
We next reproduce three definitions given in \textit{Spencer\cite{S97}}:\\
\indent\emph{Definition.} A vertex $v$ \textit{reaches} a vertex $u$ iff there is a path from $v$ to $u$. Conversely, $u$ is \textit{reachable} from $v$ iff there is path from $v$ to $u$.\\
\indent\emph{Definition.} Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph and let $R \subseteq V$. $G[R] = (R, E')$, where $E' \subseteq R \times R$.\\
\indent\emph{Definition.} Two vertices $u,v$ are \textit{identified} by replacing them with a single vertex $uv$. The outgoing edges of both $u$ and $v$ becomes the outgoing edges of $uv$ and the incoming edges of both $u$ and $v$ become the incoming edges of $uv$.
